## Installing a dev version
Uploading an AppImage using Deck DevKit
Source: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/loadgames

* Name: MinetestAppImage
* Local folder: /home/user/dev/tmp/minetestdeck/
* Upload filtering [Include only] Minetest-dev.AppImage
* Start command: Minetest-dev.AppImage
* Save config
* Click Upload
* On deck: cp /usr/lib/libcrypto.so ~/devkit-game/MinetestAppImage/libcrypto.so.1
* Luanti should now be in Non-steam games as "Devkit games: MinetestAppImage"

Note, I had issues reusing the layout from the stable version of the game. Pressing "apply layout" did nothing. I needed to follow this bizarre workaround https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/10tsp1a/i_cant_change_the_default_controller_layout/
