# Organisation
Contributors
------------

A contributor is anyone who has made a pull request that has been merged, or successfully sent a patch to be applied otherwise.

Core developers
---------------

Core developers have special privileges and responsibilities compared to other contributors:

* Can vote for and against merging pull requests (See also [Git Guidelines](/Git_Guidelines "Git Guidelines"))
* Has write access to the Luanti's team's repositories on GitHub

The core team should all be people who are trusted and capable of reviewing C++ code if you ask them to. They don't necessarily need to have the time. However, if a core developer doesn't write or review any code for a long time, the trust disappears.

#### Assignment

Core developers are assigned and unassigned by celeron55, based on these rules:

* Only people who have already contributed to the project can be assigned to be core developers.
* The person themselves or anyone else can propose someone to become or stop being a core developer. Do this by "/msg celeron55 blah blah", or by email.
* Celeron55 accepts complaints about core developers and ultimately decides on unassignments.
* Core developers, like other contributors, should document and publish their work in a way that allows another contributor to pick up on it if the core developer stops working on the project due to any reason.
* If a person doesn't use their core developer privileges for 6 months, the privileges will be revoked for security reasons.
