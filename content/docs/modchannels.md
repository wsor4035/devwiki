### Functions

#### `core.mod_channel_join(channel_name)`
* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name

* `sender`: string, empty if from a SSM, player name if from a client
* `message`: string, message

{{< /notice >}}

#### `channel:leave()`
The server will leave the channel, meaning no more messages from this channel on `core.register_on_modchannel_message`

{{< notice tip >}}
