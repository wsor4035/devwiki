# Compiling on Windows using MSYS2
MSYS2 is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native Windows software. This page lists how to compile Luanti on Windows using MSYS2.

For a video tutorial of setting up a Luanti development environment on Windows using MSYS2 (including setting up VSCodium), you can see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8eWDzLNa3E) by Exe_Virus.

## Installation
Please download and install the latest version of MSYS2 here: https://www.msys2.org/

After installation, a terminal opens. Run the following command to update the environment:

```bash
pacman -Syu
```

The terminal will then ask you to close it when done, proceed with doing so and then open the MSYS2 CLANG64 environment whose icon has a dark orange background. (For information on what the different environments do, see [Environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) in MSYS2's documentation)

## Compiling
First install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pacman -S git mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{clang,cmake,ninja,curl-winssl,libpng,libjpeg-turbo,freetype,libogg,libvorbis,sqlite3,openal,zstd,gettext,luajit,SDL2}
```

Navigate to some folder where you want to clone the Luanti repository. To get out of MSYS' home folder and into your regular users folder, you would want to enter something like this:

```bash
cd /c/Users/$USER/Desktop
```

Clone Luanti:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest
cd minetest
```

And start the building process:

```bash
mkdir build; cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja
```

Once it's finished compiling, there should be a luanti.exe executable inside of `bin/` inside your Luanti folder. You can run it inside of the MSYS2 environment by running `../bin/luanti.exe` in the terminal, but it will not work if you try to open the executable from Windows explorer, as the necessary DLLs aren't next to the executable.

## Bundling DLLs
For bundling DLLs, you may want to use [msys2-bundledlls](https://github.com/rollerozxa/msys2-bundledlls) which is able to copy over any libraries the executable is linked against and put it next to the executable.

If you're lazy, run the following commands from the build directory to download the script:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollerozxa/msys2-bundledlls/master/bundledlls > ../bundledlls
```

When you have downloaded the script, usage is as such:

```bash
../bundledlls ../bin/luanti.exe ../bin/
```

It will print out a list of libraries it has copied to the binary folder once finished. Now it should be possible to run the Luanti executable outside of the MSYS2 environment.

## Notes

### Something about packages being untrusted or corrupted?
If you have an existing MSYS2 install that has been dormant for a while without updates, you might run into issues trying to install or update packages as the keyring is outdated. See [this section](https://www.msys2.org/docs/updating/#potential-issues) on the MSYS2 website on how to solve this.

### Building 32-bit
If you want to build a 32-bit version of Luanti you would want to use the CLANG32 environment (light orange background).

When installing dependencies, use the `mingw-w64-clang-i686-` prefix used for CLANG32 packages instead of `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-`.

### Graphics is broken in a VM
If you're doing this inside of a VM and you want to test the executable but get graphics issues due to a lack of hardware acceleration, you can try downloading the Mesa software renderer as a DLL. [Download the 64-bit version of the DLL here](https://fdossena.com/?p=mesa/index.frag) and put it next to the executable in `bin/`. It will be slow but should be usable for testing.
